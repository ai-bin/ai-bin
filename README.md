[Read the manual](/aibin/man)


## Get started (aka early [man](/aibin/tools/man))

Aibin could be seen as an art-generation tool. A good way to start is to train an instance of Aibin with your own creation protocol.

### Example : (Clueless essay on technology and independance)[/aibin/tools/protocols/#0909-essay.md]

- Pick 3 words with [Ashine](/aibin/tools/ashine), Aibin's Shared Interests Generator OR [/aibin/tools/new](add your own)

```
Technology, Lack, Independance
```

- Dump your brain

Brain-dumping is a process where you try to match your thougths stream with a computationable output (eg: ``Define`` searches a dictionnary, ``Ask`` searches Q&A ressources, ``Read`` searches original ressources )

```
Define : technology, lack, independance
Ask : Why would I need an artificial brain ?, Who could I trust if I'm not even trustworthy myself ?, What is a strong/weak relation between technology and humans ?
Read : Welcome to the Jungle nÂ°6, p25
```

- Train your instance

```
/aibin train
```
